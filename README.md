# Project-Flexbox
A simple tool for visualizing the CSS flex-box model.
This is a flex-box sandbox. Use the interface to add, remove, and modify the colorful div elements within the flex-box provided.
I hope that my app supports you through your development journey. Any support or feedback is appreciated.
